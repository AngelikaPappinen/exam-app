    I have made my internship in City of Helsinki Cultural office in 2014. My job included working with customers, working with different devices such as smartphones, computers, tablets and printers; repairing and maintaining. In summer 2014 I have been working in City of Helsinki Sport Office as a program tester. I had internship in Suzhou, China in Spring of 2014; there we had a project to develop a smartphone game in a big team. This internship had positive affect on me such as stronger self-confidence, basic knowledge in programming, experience of working as a part of big and international team, friendship and certificate.
    
    I feel myself confident with the abilities which you require from applicant, my studies in college and in University included these assignments. Also I already had opportunity to do these tasks in my previous work places. I have enough education in this field and I am able to learn very fast everything you want me to know. I am also more than ready to improve my skills.
